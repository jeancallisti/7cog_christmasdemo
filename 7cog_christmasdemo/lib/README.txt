IMPORTANT

This folder contains some AGS games that are used as EXTERNAL LIBS to the main game.
- The .asc and .ash files are "included" in the main game by editing 7CoG's game.agf and changing the path of the modules to a relative path (e.g. changing DoubleClick.ash to ./lib/DoubleClick.ash)
- the "game.ags" and other files that are present in each of these subfolders are only the demo games built around each of these modules. You could remove every file in the subfolders under /lib/ except the .ash and .asc files, and 7CoG would still work.
