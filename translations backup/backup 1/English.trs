Well actually I did!

Who ARE you?

How did YOU get in here?

I sell these fine leather jackets.

You thought you could get away that easily!

Wake up, pal. It's 1938! It belongs in a museum!

Do you think Jesus' toe is actually in this box?

The catacombs are outside monastery land.

I was hired by the Vatican.

I am brother Bernard, of the monastery of Saint-Luc,

and this OUR crypt!

How DARE you trespass and steal our most precious property?

Give back the toe at once!

ENOUGH OF THAT NONSENSE!

I know all the secret passages!

Give me the box this instant or I lock you up in here!

OK, pal, no need to go all inquisitor on me.

Here you go.

Umph.

Now, maybe we can talk?

Look, we started on the wrong FOOT...

Aren't you curious about what's REALLY inside?

If you knew me better you'd trust me.

It's fake anyways.

Stamp collections are less idiotic than relics.

So, you like relics... And beer, apparently.

VER:1.1DATA:Are you trying to be funny, thief?

VER:1.1DATA:Well, you know...

VER:1.1DATA:Since the box supposedly contains a toe or whatnot...

VER:1.1DATA:Aren't you curious about what's REALLY inside?

VER:1.1DATA:No one looks at the relic! Even me, its guardian!

In 10 centuries, we have never had the audacity to open this box.

VER:1.1DATA:If you knew me better you'd trust me.

VER:1.1DATA:I hate EVERYTHING about you.

VER:1.1DATA:Oh come on, now...

VER:1.1DATA:WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?

VER:1.1DATA:The nerve of--

VER:1.1DATA:Stamp collections are less idiotic than relics.

VER:1.1DATA:EXCUSE ME?!?

VER:1.1DATA:How dare you--

VER:1.1DATA:So, you like relics... And beer, apparently.

VER:1.1DATA:I BEG YOUR PARDON?!?

VER:1.1DATA:I don't even know what to--

BLASPHEMY!

I WARNED YOU to respect the name of the Lord in my presence!

Easy there, pal.

I've had enough of your sarcastic tone and your cursing!

For ONCE in your miserable life you will lay eyes on the most precious relic!

And then never again!

BEHOLD!

...

It's empty, you know.

!?!

Let me see.

It's-- It's empty!

That can't be!

Look, there are some unusual scratchings inside.

Wait a minute, these are not scratchings!

This is the runic alphabet!

The letters seem to have been carved hastily with a sharp object.

Do you understand this pagan language? What does it say?

I'm a bit rusty, the real specialist here would be Marcus.

Who?

Never mind.

I believe it says...

"Agsvald was here"

Wh-- Are you sure?

Yikes!

Do you hear yourself?

Golly!

These are strong words.

Zounds!

Thats sounds extreme!

Bejabbers!

Did you really say that?

Ouch!

Jiminy Cricket!

For God's sake!

Are you for real?

That hurt.

Everyone LOVES the way I look.

Everyone LOVES the way I dress.

Everyone LOVES the way I talk.

Everyone LOVES the way I use my smarts.

VER:1.1DATA:Everyone LOVES the way I look.

VER:1.1DATA:Your hat is covered in cobwebs and your face is all bruised!

VER:1.1DATA:Fair enough.

VER:1.1DATA:Everyone LOVES the way I dress.

VER:1.1DATA:Button up that shirt, will you, punk?

VER:1.1DATA:Everyone LOVES the way I talk.

VER:1.1DATA:With all your cursing?

VER:1.1DATA:Dammit! I only--

VER:1.1DATA:...

VER:1.1DATA:But I've heard worse.

VER:1.1DATA:The one thing I hate is BLASPHEMY.

VER:1.1DATA:'Taking the name of the Lord thy God in vain.'?

VER:1.1DATA:Hearing God's name used as a curse makes me so furious I could just--

VER:1.1DATA:But why am I even talking with you?

VER:1.1DATA:Everyone LOVES the way I use my smarts.

VER:1.1DATA:Don't make me laugh. You can't even leave this room.

Strange as it sounds, I'm pretty sure.

Agsvald sounds like a Viking name.

When did you last check on the relic?

You should have picked Runic over Latin.

That is a CATASTROPHY!

We've been watching over the Holy remains for almost a millenium!

You're telling me that all that time they had been taken away?

And by some bearded pagan adventurer at that!

Wait, there's more.

"Come get the body parts of your whiny god in Nissefest, if you dare."

Our Lord is not whiny! How dare you!

Hey, I'm just reading it as it is. Our friend Agsvald knows how to tease.

What is this Nissefest he's talking about?

I think it used to be a Viking settlement in Norway, many centuries ago.

My son, the time has come for you to answer to a higher calling.

You must be kidding me.

You must bring back the relic, the salvation of your soul depends on it.

Yeah, yeah.

Plus, I would let you see the rare manuscripts of our monastry.

Say no more.

monkDialogFinished

I'm done with you.

I've had enough.

Me and my relic, we're gone.

Wait!

What now.

Can't you find the exit yourself?

Don't insist, the reliquary stays closed.

VER:1.1DATA:Oh, I see what you're doing.

VER:1.1DATA:You think that if I lose my temper I might open the box.

VER:1.1DATA:Well, joke's on you because...

VER:1.1DATA:I'M NOT THE ONE WHO WILL ROT IN HELL!

VER:1.1DATA:I'M NOT THE DEPRAVED SINNER IN THIS ROOM!

VER:1.1DATA:UNLIKE YOU, I KNOW WHAT VIRTUE IS!

Hello! I'm an American archeologist.

Could I speak to someone in town?

Maybe I can help you with your boat?

What is it you need again?

I'll let you work.

Oj, oj, oj.

Sorry sir, I'm too busy, I cannot help you.

It's the fishing season. Everyone's at sea from dusk till dawn.

Except for me. My boat is damaged and I must fix it urgently.

I really don't have time to talk, good bye sir.

Ha! I don't think so.

This old thing's engine has been patched so many times...

...I'm probably the only person to know how to make it work.

It used to finish the Fjord run in 12 nautic miles, you know.

Anyways I'm too busy to continue this little chat.

But if I help you fix it will you answer my questions?

Listen min herr, I told you--

Hmm...

OK, listen.

Next to the church, there's an old storehouse where I keep some tools.

And inside of it there's a hose. Bring it back to me and we'll see.

In the meantime I'll be busy with min lille hammer.

hasReceivedFishermanMission

Oj! I thought I was clear!

Bring me the hose that's in the old storehouse, and I'll help you.

Hurry up please, while I tighten a few bolts.

If you don't mind.

About the church...

About that pile of ashes on the hill...

Seen any vikings around  lately?

Bye bye.

Yes?

Ha! Ha!

Bye bye!

Does your church host a relic or two?

Quite authentic!

I've noticed those strange holes in the wall...

Can you sing one of his songs?

Would you sing another song?

How about another song?

You have quite the sense of humor!

But it's a tiny church. No relics. Not even a crypt.

Yes, it's extremely old. From the times of massive Christian conversions.

I even believe it was built on top of the Viking common hall.

Peculiar, aren't they?

As a kid, I used to imagine it was the holes of a flute.

I get it. A boring mass can make the mind wander.

Not only that, but our priest enjoyed music a lot.

He had lots of songs to help us remember events and dates from the Bible.

Do you mean... Songs he invented himself?

Yes.

Well, erm... That's a bit embarrassing.

Come on, I helped you with your engine.

Wouldn't you prefer a drinking song?

OK, here goes :

'Adam has Abel, that's one son...',

'Adam has Cain, that's two sons...'

'Cain kills Abel, that's one son again...'

'Adam has Seth, that's two sons again...'

I think I get the gist of it.

That's a boring song but thanks to it I never forgot the genealogy of Adam.

I wish my dad knew how to sing.

How about this one:

'the hip bone connects to the leg bone,'

'The leg bone connects to the--'

I already know that one.

Yes, I think the priest adapted it from a famous song.

I don't know any more songs but that one:

'A door has a lock, the lock needs a key',

'Push it three times!'

'The lock can also be a key',

'Then the lock opens another door',

The tune is catchy.

Yes. The priest was singing to himself very often. I remember it to this day.

hasRevealedDoorMechanism

When did it burn?

I've seen some runes next to it.

Nevermind

Very recently, actually.

It belonged to our priest's family since forever.

Do you mean they maintained it?

Yes, with great care. God knows why.

So, when the priest died it went derelict.

Yes, and then this mysterious fire.

Somehow, the soil is always hot up there, even in winter.

Could it have started the fire?

Possibly.

Oh yes it's extremely old.

There used to be a Viking settlement up there. That furnace was the last remaining trace.

Once, I saw the INSIDE of the furnace door.

It's beautiful: Ornamented and all.

Have you heard of a Viking named Agsvald?

Do you have... A Vikings museum of some sort?

Nevermind.

Oh yes he was the big shot around here in the early middle ages.

He kept going on raids to Great Britain, and even to France!

To France? Interesting.

The rumour says that he stashed a treasure somewhere here.

But guess what, no one ever found it.

Oh, no. The mountain is littered with Viking artifacts.

But we're just a small fishing village. I know the stories my grandma's grandma told her.

So... No reliable source of information?

Well, our priest and his family seemed to know many secrets about this Agsvald guy!

That priest didn't have any children, sadly. His secrets died with him.

ERROR: in 'ToModernAudio' : Unexpected sound index

If I want to use this door, I should OPEN it.

It's an average door.

I can't pick the door up!

Sure, I should just start talking to doors.

The door works fine. If I want to use this door, I should OPEN it.

It's already open.

It's already closed.

Error: findDoorIndex: Couldn't find the requested door in room %d

Error in 'Doors' module : bad door id : (id=%d, but should be between 0 and %d

Fatal error: too many rooms to handle doors

Fatal error: too many doors declared

It's already properly closed.

It's an oil can I took from the janitor's closet.

I'd rather not, I might spill the oil.

Why would my cabinet key open this oil can?

...And risk having my papers ruined?

It's the key to my office cabinet.

...And have the key all slimy? No, thanks!

Let's take a look at that telegram.

There's no envelope. Nothing to open.

No way, that would ruin the telegram.

That's my wallet.

There's nothing of interest in it.

Why would I spill oil all over my papers?

Apparently it's some sophisticated metal compass.

It's from the the early Ottoman Empire, at the end of the middle ages.

It was used by muslim artists and decorators.

They were ornamenting everything with geometric shapes in that era.

That device helped designing them.

Yes, that's defnitely the artifact the tag is about.

eDialog_LookedAtCompassTag

It's a strange metal artifact. I can't date it, and I don't know what it's for.

Thanks to the tag, I know what this artifact is.

There's no point in disassembling it.

Hey! It's the description tag of that ancient metal device.

Irene probably left the tag in my drawer to make sure it wouldn't be lost.

It's one of those tags we use to classify our artifacts.

Here is what it says:

It's the description tag of one of the many artifacts we have in Barnett college.

I don't know what artifact it describes.

I'm not waving that around.

eDialog_IndyConfusedHammers

It's a ceremonial hammer... But I don't know if it's a copy.

It's a ceremonial hammer. That's the real one.

I looks really very much like the real one.

It's a tire repair kit.

A short, sturdy stick.

It fits. I got myself a nice shovel.

It's an empty bucket.

Luckily, the salted water doesn't seem to be freezing.

It's all rusty but it could do the job if it had a handle.

It fits!

Let me adjust the nail... Voila!

It's not the right size at all.

It can't even sharpen the wood to make it fit.

eDialog_isOilLampBurning

There, now it's lit.

The lamp is already lit.

It was more of a censer apparently, but now it's used as a plain oil lamp.

It has a gentle little flame coming out of it, as expected.

There's oil inside but it's not lit.

I don't want to put oil all over it.

There's only oil inside, I don't want to spill it.

Talk to me, o genie of the lamp.

[ACHIEVEMENT[[Friend of the Djinns.[[Post a screenshot on Twitter #RelicOfTheViking[[

Careful not to hurt your fingers if you try to burn ropes.

I don't want to burn that.

There's a tiny amount of fuel inside, I don't want to spill it.

This is a long paddling oar.

I have no idea how it fits in my pants.

Unusally big and thick!

Those Norwegians are not fooling around.

It's a small, simple golden key. It looks worn off.

It's a shovel.

It's an old plastic hose without much value.

Unbelievable! It's a MASSIVE ruby!

It's an enormous sapphire. I can't believe my eyes.

They'll never believe me, back at the geology department.

I should probably put in a word for a new one.

I have better things to do than rehearsing my course.

This isn't some secret passage leading to a crazed genius who creates evil mutant tentacles.

I read that in 'Detective Illustrated' at the barber's.

I'm done for today.

It's flat, and it has drawers. It's a desk.

I don't think there is anything else in it.

I don't think there is anything in that drawer that can help.

Wait! There is a small tag. I don't recall putting it in here.

I'll take it.

I have more urgent matters to attend to, right now.

I don't want to pull that.

That wouldn't work.

I have nothing to add to the billboard.

It can't be opened.

It can't be closed.

It's a billboard.

FOR SALE: 1938 Packard. Call Frank.

Debate this Monday Night - The Holy Grail: Myth or Reality?

I think I know the answer to that question...

This space is for rent. Contact R. Derocher.

WANTED: Gas for a chainsaw. Call Dave.

Vote Gracie Allen for President.

Meeting of Barnett Shakespeare Society this Tuesday in the auditorium.

FOR SALE: Collection of Buck Rogers comic books. Call Earl.

WANTED: Lab Assistant. Good pay. No questions asked. Call Doctor Fred.

Movie Saturday night: Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn.

It's too heavy to lift.

A billboard that talks? Now that's a novel concept.

I have a feeling that won't work.

Let's see if there is anything interesting back there.

Nope. What did I expect to find in an empty classroom?

eDialog_StudentsPuzzleFullyResolved

Professor!

Where are you going?

Are you even listening to us?

We need an answer!

Yes, yes, of course I'm listening. I'm not leaving before we find a solution together.

Someone left that artifact on my desk before the class.

Probably Irene, my secretary.

I suppose a colleague of mine thought it would be of interest for me.

FOR SALE: A math hand book. Will sell for $50,[ or trade for new slide rule.

It's the telegraph from Marcus. It says to meet him in Arizona.

It's the key to my office.

... This stone artifact was discovered in my class dig.

Several other Aborigine artifacts were discovered in the dig.

Now the dig wasn't a major dig and the artifacts we discovered were not major finds...

But each piece of history that archeology can uncover is important in the large scale of things...

Every clue to man's past is a vital piece of knowledge.

That's an impressive pile of bones.

A tinted glass? Underground?

It's open now.

That was too close for my comfort.

I'm not going back there before I find the relic.

Enter the elusive reliquary.

Let's snatch this thing before I get into any more trouble.

Reliquaries usually contain bogus body parts.

I wonder what this one actually contains?

Those look pretty steady.

I don't think they're hiding anything.

I hope that mine won't end up there.

I don't see anything special there.

I don't think it can be pushed or moved.

It's just painted on.

I've seen this symbol before.

But where?

I hope the trip was worth it.

The door is unlocked.

That makes no sense.

A large pile of half-frozen snow has cluttered the old iron door.

No, there is no time for snowballing.

Usually I pay some kids to shovel the snow off my sidewalk.

Phew!

I can get snow anywhere, but I don't think I need fresh water.

Can you imagine how much salt water I'd need to melt that much snow?

That wouldn't work: The snow is slightly frozen and the oar is far from sharp.

eDialog_DoorState

It seems to have some ornament on the inside. Strange!

The angle's not right, I don't see anything. I'd need to open it.

There. It's still awfully rusty but at least it's not welded shut.

eDialog_hasDoorBeenOiled

Hey, this oar is probably over a thousand years old. I won't use it as a lever!

It would surely break it.

This door is completely gripped! It won't move at all.

eDialog_DoorCounter

Hmmm, it's getting better. Let's do it again.

I think it's time for a final pull instead.

It's very rusty, it got stuck half-way. I might loosen it with some efforts.

Almost there. One of the hinges is crumbling away though.

It won't open further. I need to continue making it move in either direction.

OK, one final push should do it!

*CLUNK!*

*CRACK!*

I'm just glad it didn't fall on my feet.

eDialog_IceCrackOpened

I should try to get rid of that ice.

I see someone rummaging inside, but whoever it is they don't notice me.

AHOY! ANYONE ON BOARD?

Hva er det?

hasHelpedFisherman

Look, I found the hose you were asking for.

Wonderful! Let me try my little experiment.

*CLANG!*

*BONK!*

It works!

Thank you mister!

Now, tell me. How can I help you?

Tusen takk again for helping me! I'm confident I can sail away tomorrow at dawn.

Shaking the boat will only make them hostile. Why not just call?

The boat is surely open already, but there's someone inside.

Why not just call?

There are a few houses and buildings but I wonder where is everyone.

The sea seems pretty still.

The bucket is already full.

It's one of those medieval Scandinavian churches, entirely made of wood.

It's exceptionally well preserved.

Even though it's technically christian, I'm certain Vikings were still around when it was built.

Found it!

There's a TON of junk in there, but it's too dark.

A lighter is not bright enough to search through it.

There's a lot of useless junk in there.

That wasn't easy.

I also found a shovel head. Not brand new but still good.

I don't think I'll find anything useful anymore in there.

Those old storehouses can be found everywhere.

Scandinavians would preserve salted meet and other goods in them.

I'd say it was a furnace or an oven. It's OLD.

But it looks like it burnt very recently.

There are just some remains of this so called building.

I don't want to destroy this completely!

No doubt, there used to be some Vikings nearby.

Why should I wandering around with that stone at my back?

If I didn't know better, I'd say this stone looks like... An ancient pipe?

I pops straight out of the ice wall... And back again into the ground, to God knows where.

It's a huge stone literally popping out of the mountain.

There's something going on behind that wall.

My fiddling with the pipes did something!

This steam is going somewhere.

Let's have a closer look...

It's made of massive font... Let's leave it here.

HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL OF YOU FROM THE SEVEN CITIES DEVELOPMENT TEAM!

THE END

WHO DARES WAKING ME FROM MY ETERNAL SLUMBER?

Uh oh!

I'm afraid that was me, Agsvald!

DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

Well yes, you wrote it for me.

Do you remember now?

IF I HAD TO REMEMBER ALL THE PLACES WHERE I WROTE MY NAME!

That's not a very dignified answer...

I'VE ALWAYS FOUND LOKI MORE INSPIRATIONAL THAN ODIN.

No kidding.

DID YOU COME LOOKING AFTER YOUR SHIELDLESS GOD?

Well now it doesn't seem that important anymore.

HA! HA! HA!

Easy there, Nur-Ab-Sal.

NUR AB WHO?

TONIGHT IS A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT!

IT WILL BE THE LONGEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR.

So?

THIS MUST BE CELEBRATED, AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN.

With flowers and dances?

NO, WITH BEER AND DRUNKEN SINGING.

I MUST GO NOW, THEY ARE ALL WAITING FOR ME.

HO HO HO!

I should go downstairs to do that.

It's an ancient baptism font. I guess it had a different purpose in Viking times.

It's right in front of that curved line on the floor.

The bucket is empty. I'm no magician.

It's a handwritten note pinned to the wall.

It says : 'The key is behind the cross'.

I don't see any cross.

This one represents the resurrection of Jesus.

It's worthless.

This one represents Jesus being crucified.

Hey! There's a small key taped behind the painting!

I've already taken the key.

This one represents a Roman soldier putting a crown of thorns on Jesus' head.

This one represents Jesus healing the lepers.

This one represents Joseph of Arimathea collecting the blood of Jesus in the Grail.

I should go upstairs to do that.

These stairs lead to the ground floor.

hasTakenGum

My parents made me sit countless hours on those church benches.

I remember how rugged the wood felt.

Yuck! There's a gum glued to it!

It's one of those awful old 'gums' made of chewed bark.

Oh well, now that I've touched it.

I'm not starting a collection of old chewing gum, thanks.

Gross.

A rowing paddle. Not too surprising when everyone here is a fisherman.

It seems in good shape.

Why not.

I used an old technique for efficient packing.

It was invented by pirates in the Caribbeans.

A medieval shield used as a decoration.

That's weird. The shield seems to be attached to an axis.

This stelle has drawings of fog horns on it.

There's a hole carved into each drawing. They seem to be running deep.

Wow!

POOOOOOOO

Agsvald's fog horns! Alright!

pshhhhh...

Umph. It doesn't sound like a proper melody?

Some sea water mist!

*Crrrrrrr*

It's like they're moving along a wave! Perfect!

They're just clunking but nothing good seems to be happening.

The dragon is coming to life!

Something is not quite triggering there.

The stone is very hot, but... Not mist at all.

Pretty disappointing.

I have a hunch that's not just an art installment.

Well, at least SOME of it seemed correct.

I need to make this thing work!

This dragon has an unusually long tongue.

I can't pick it up entirely but it seems to be able to slide.

Nothing happened.

I don't see the mop.

There's a small oil lamp resting on the basin.

I was sent by church representatives, after all.

There's only the stick, the rest is missing.

This is a massive dragon head carved in wood.

It still has tiny seashells here and there.

I think it could have been at the front of a Viking longboat.

It won't budge.

I'm too far away.

It seems like my fiddling with the pipes did something after all.

Just the striking plate to the door's lock.

A secret compartment just opened at the back of the cabinet!

WOW! It contains two huge gems!

I believe this church holds many secrets.

I think there's nothing more here.

A star represents the soul. I've never seen that before.

The drawing is lacking some details but that's definitely the one.

Marcus confirmed my translation. Everything is OK.

It says here:

I'm certain that this relic is hidden in this crypt.

...But where?

Note

Saint's head

Those are very condensed runes, but it's along the lines of:

'Agsvald's ship sails away in the morning mist,'

'All shields readied',

'War horns playing his battle tune.'

It looks suspiciously identical to the dragon head in the church.

This rune is a letter but it also means 'Sun'.

This rune is a letter but it also means 'Sea'.

This rune is a letter but it also means 'Blood'.

Talk about tantalizing!

Climbing up a steep wall made of smooth ice? Sounds easy... and safe.

It's not jousting, but almost.

At least Marcus won't tell it's wasn't worth buying my ticket to Norway.

It's way too short!

Well, well, well.

 It seems our friend Agsvald kept some secrets after all.

Up and ready to sail!

...Or to raid.
