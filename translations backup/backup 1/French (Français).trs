Do you want to hear about my trip to the Orient?

How have things been here at Barnett?
?????
Have you seen Marcus?

Water balloon incident?

Can you tell me anything about that trip Marcus went on?

What was that about Marcus again?

Goodbye.

In all honesty, no. I have a ton of marking to do.

Things have been going well here. Except for that "Water balloon incident"... Don't ask.

Marcus? He left last week on a trip to the Southwest, I believe.

Well, it all started a week ago when two students decided to... No, no, I'm not going through this again. It's in the past, Indy, leave it there.

Sorry, no.  Wait... That reminds me. I believe a telegram arrived this morning for you, check with your secretary.

Thanks for the information.

You were sent a telegraph, go to your secretary to find out more.

Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

I heard that a telegram came in for me?

Do you want to hear about my trip?

Irene do you have a spare key?

No, I haven't.

Oh, yes... It slipped my mind. A telegram from Marcus arrived for you this morning...

I put it in your file cabinet in your office...

Here, take this key for your office cabinet.

Thanks.

Not now, I'm very busy.

For your cabinet again Doctor Jones? Yes, right here.

Bye, Doctor Jones.

Maybe this will teach you to apply yourselves.

You shouldn't be surprised, you've been failing all year long.

Well, you did put that frog in Irene's desk...

Well, you did hang Professor Mulbray's shorts from the flagpole...

Well, you did egg Marcus Brody's car...

Well, you did throw a rock through the dean's window...

Really?  Maybe we'll win some games now.

Maybe when you learn to behave then they'll let you play again.

I was just doing my duty as a teacher here.

Yeah, well, maybe me and Bruno have more important things to worry about than people who find old junk in the dirt! Right, Bruno?

Haw, haw, haw!

And that's not all! You also ratted us out to the principal for being trouble makers!

Hey, we were trying to give her a little gift!

Well, that's not the worst of it, teach! Because of what you did, we have been suspended from the team!

Well, ok, maybe we did do that...

Hey! We were just eating lunch when the eggs... Uh... Slipped out of our hands!

That was an accident! The rock slipped out of my hand as I was... Uh... Cleaning it!

Well, you're going to be sorry for messing with us, teach! Right, Bruno?

What is it again that you expect me to do, young man?

I need to hear NOT USED

Don't you think that's a little disrespectful?

I'm counting to three...

I've had enough of your behaviour!

I need to hear everyone's opinion before I take my decision.

ZZzzzZZZZ...

I have a feeling that...

...I'm not getting out of this room any time soon...

ZZzzzzzzzzzz...

ZZzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZzzz!

*dribbles*

Professor!

Stop!

Ignore Biff!

We need your attention!

Yes, yes, forgive me, I got carried away.

*snort*

Charming.

Do you have a favorite topic?

I need to hear everyone's opinion.

Yes, I like Romans.

Yes, they're quite fascinating.

Please hurry, professor.

I don't know... I enjoy doing research about the Orient.

I understand, they have such a mystical spirituality!

Yes, but I prefer their means of visual expression.

Comic books have always been more attractive than sacred books I suppose.

Yes, I like everything related to crafting.

I've heard you're quite the manual guy. Keep it up!

What is it again that you expect me to do?

Tell me again what you expect from me?

How about each of you picks a subject that suits them?

I actually have the subject just right here...

Listen, all of you, I've chosen a subject.

NOT USED

Do you have a particular field of interest?

Professor, we've been asking you the same thing for the last three weeks!!!

The holidays are coming, and the final exams after that.

So, I suppose that's a relief for all of you?

Not at all, professor! We're still waiting on you.

Please pick a subject for our final essay with you!

Oh, haven't I already? I thought I had.

Not at all! We've been asking you at the end of every class.

It's been weeks, now. And you keep postponing.

Without the subject, we'll have way too much work at the end of the semester.

We can't wait any longer!

I understand.

We need you to give us a subject for our final essay.

That's not fair!

What about the grades?

We don't have time for that!

You made us wait for that?

Professor, it wouldn't be fair to let everyone pick their own subject.

Then how would we be sure that the evaluation is unbiased?

Yes, of course. The bias. I was going to say that.

You scared us!

At last!

I knew it!

Thanks, professor.

How about...

The subject will be...

It's not my role to tell what should be the essay's subject.

Still, tell me what's your favorite topic in Archeology.

I like everything that announces the Renaissance period.

Oh yes. The end of very old Empires... Tragic.

...Medieval Spain fiefdoms?

...Archaic Greece politics?

...Antic Cretan symbolism?

...Mayan economics?

I need to think more about it

What?

But!

No!

Why?

Professor, you already gave us that topic last semester!

Oh yes, that's absolutely true. Apologies.

Professor, Mr. McCumber gave that exact same subject to his students two weeks ago.

They would have an advantage over us!

My my, that's right. Apologies.

This subject is on next year's program.

Oh yes, my bad. Apologies.

We never studied that with you, professor.

Indeed, I did that with another class. Apologies.

wood carving

giant stone structures

metal foundries design

clay extraction

Oh wait, what was I saying?

trading

catling

artwork

religion

Constantinople

Padua

Rome

Goa

Attila's ruling

Scipio Africanus' command

Mehmet II's reign

Barbarossa's reign

"The many uses of...

...in the field of...

...in...

...at the time of...

Attila's ruling".

Scipio Africanus' command".

Mehmet II's reign".

Barbarossa's reign".

"The many uses of wood carving in the field of artwork...

...in Constantinople at the time of Mehmet II's reign."

That sounds like a very interesting subject, professor.

I hope you didn't pick something oriental just for me!

I like that it's about the Eastern Roman Empire.

And it's about sculpting artwork.

Thanks for considering choosing the very beginning of the renaissance!

So, you all like the topic?

Yes, and that artifact is a great motivation...

The first Ottomans were having close relations with Constantinople...

Indeed. Maybe this artifact is of Byzantine influence!

I'm sure the whole class will work heartily on that essay!

Then we're all happy.

Now, can you please all get out?

So, are you ready to start working on that essay, now?

To tell the truth...

What, don't tell me you're still not happy?!?

It's too abstract!

We need a visual support!

Show us an artifact!

We wouldn't know where to start!

You see, professor, other teachers usually show us an artifact

to make the subject more interesting...

...And I didn't.

Are you saying my classes are boring?

Not at all, professor. You know I find you amazing.

I mean, your classes.

That's a relief.

...But I can't force the class to be really interested in that subject.

Unless I show them a great artifact.

Yes.

I can't pull that.

I can't push that.

That just won't work.

I don't know what to do.

I see nothing special about it.

Why would I want to pick that up?

I shouldn't start talking to things.

That won't work.

I can't open that.

I can't close that.

I don't need that.

It's too heavy to pull it

It's too heavy to push it

I can't pick up something that big!

Violence is not a solution here.

I don't just push people around.

I'll keep that to myself.

I don't randomly touch people.

Yes, why don't I just carry everybody around on my back?

You mean, open that person with a knife or something?

That doesn't make sense.

I don't think that will work.

Nu-uh.

No.

Nope.

That's silly.

Why would I try that?

I'll have to think of something more useful.

No way.

I can't figure it out.

I'd rather keep that to myself.

I won't give that away.

Bad idea.

Let's keep that to myself.

I can't pull him, he's not a lever.

I don't think Mulbray needs to see my wallet.

How would you tell which hammer is genuine, and which one is fake?

Hmm... They look exactly the same. That's amazing.

It's that student.. You know? the head of copy club.

He's really brought copy techniques to a whole new level.

...But I'd say this is the genuine hammer.

genuine hammer

copy of hammer

Thanks a lot!

I don't think he'd like that.

Mulbray isn't a door.

Hello, Professor...

Welcome back, Doctor Jones... I trust your trip to the Orient went well?

Yes, I guess it did...

Well, that's good to hear.

It's Professor Mulbray.

I can't pick up Mulbray...

That wouldn't do anything.

Why would I want to do that?!

No, I have a feeling I'll need it.

I don't think she'd like that.

Not now, maybe later...

Good afternoon, Irene.

Good afternoon, and welcome back Doctor Jones.

It's Irene, my secretary.

There's no way I'd ever do that.

He's a jerk, but that doesn't mean I should be pushing them around.

I have no need to bribe them.

... But I'd pay him if he'd wash my car.

I doubt that would change anything.

That can't work.

Hello, Biff...

Hey teach, you have some nerve for flunking us!

Ah yes, that last test...

Yeah, well me and Bruno aren't happy about it!

Talking to them anymore would be a waste of time.

One of Barnett College's juvenile delinquents.

No, that wouldn't be good idea..

I don't think so.

He doesn't seem to be the talkative type.

Come on, Jones, you've asked enough questions now...

...You should be able to come up with something without guessing.

I won't get anywhere that way...

...I can't just make up topics.

ShowCompass: not implemented yet

What do you think of that interesting piece of history, young man?

...ZzzZZzzzz...

I should throw it at his face.

Sandy, I understand you'll be talking on behalf of your fellow students?

Yes, professor.

Don't you find that artifact interesting?

It looks nice, professor. What is it exactly?

It's a metal compass from the early Ottoman Empire.

Oh, professor, that sounds like a fascinating starting point!

I'm sure this artifact would stimulate us all!

But what subject do you want us to write about, based on it?

Sandy, that's very simple.

I suggest...

Well Sandy, I, erm....

I suppose you could write on...

Well, it's a...

It's definitely...

Give me a second, Sandy, I can't answer all the questions at the same time!

I'm growing old if I let students outsmart me...

Now, Wendy, you're a reasonable student. What's the matter?

Professor, you should ask Sandy, she's the class president.

Doesn't that artifact stimulate your curiosity?

Hmm...Interesting. Show it to Sandy, professor.

Well, well, Ron. What's all the fuss about?

Sandy, please explain Professor Jones what the issue is.

That artifact catches the eye, doesn't it?

It lsure does, professor. But show it to Sandy, please.

Young man, why don't you start from the beginning?

I think it's better if you ask Sandy, professor.

She's better at explaining.

I'm sure you could write a brilliant essay, based on that.

Professor, maybe Sandy could have a closer look?

Why does it always have to be about gigantic things?

Pity it's never about human-sized, individual creations.

Here we go again. Religion, religion, religion.

So much for visual expression.

And I have a feeling this class is a bit Europe-centered.

What does Attila have to do with any of this?

That doesn't even make sense historically!

The German Romans setting colonies in India? Well that's new...

Does every essay have to deal with Antiquity or the Middle Ages?

Professor, why do you pick the city of Rome?

It wasn't the center of the Empire at the time...

Now, now. Enough complaining. That subject is not perfect, alright.

I made a mistake. Let me fix that.

I'd rather not, I might spill the oil.

It's already properly closed.

It's an oil can I took from the janitor's closet.

Why would my cabinet key open this oil can?

...And risk having my papers ruined?

It's the key to my office cabinet.

...And have the key all slimy? No, thanks!

Let's take a look at that telegram.

There's no envelope. Nothing to open.

No way, that would ruin the telegram.

That's my wallet.

There's nothing of interest in it.

Why would I spill oil all over my papers?

Apparently it's some sophisticated metal compass.

It's from the the early Ottoman Empire, at the end of the middle ages.

It was used by muslim artists and decorators.

They were ornamenting everything with geometric shapes in that era.

That device helped designing them.

Yes, that's defnitely the artifact the tag is about.

It's a strange metal artifact. I can't date it, and I don't know what it's for.

Thanks to the tag, I know what this artifact is.

There's no point in disassembling it.

Hey! It's the description tag of that ancient metal device.

Irene probably left the tag in my drawer to make sure it wouldn't be lost.

It's one of those tags we use to classify our artifacts.

Here is what it says:

It's a ceremonial hammer... But I don't know if it's a copy.

It's a ceremonial hammer. That's the real one.

I'm not waving that around.

I looks really very much like the real one.

OK, then... Read chapters 21 and 22 for next week. You are dismissed.

Wait!
Attendez!
The essay!

We need to know!

I'm sorry, what? Not all at the same time, please!

The final essay!

The holidays are coming!

The subject!

You promised!

Oh, it's about that final essay again, is it?

At last.

It's good to be back here at Barnett College. My last trip to the Orient wasn't very restful.

I wonder where Marcus is? I haven't seen him since I've gotten back... I better find out where he is.

I should find Marcus.

I should probably put in a word for a new one.

I have better things to do than rehearsing my course.

This isn't some secret passage leading to a crazed genius who creates evil mutant tentacles.

I read that in 'Detective Illustrated' at the barber's.

I'm done for today.

It's flat, and it has drawers. It's a desk.

I don't think there is anything else in it.

I don't think there is anything in that drawer that can help.

Wait! There is a small tag. I don't recall putting it in here.

I'll take it.

I have more urgent matters to attend to, right now.

I don't want to pull that.

That wouldn't work.

I have nothing to add to the billboard.

It can't be opened.

It can't be closed.

It's a billboard.

FOR SALE: 1938 Packard. Call Frank.

I have a feeling that won't work.

Let's see if there is anything interesting back there.

Nope. What did I expect to find in an empty classroom?

Where are you going?

Are you even listening to us?

We need an answer!

Yes, yes, of course I'm listening. I'm not leaving before we find a solution together.

Someone left that artifact on my desk before the class.

Probably Irene, my secretary.

I suppose a colleague of mine thought it would be of interest for me.

FOR SALE: A math hand book. Will sell for $50,[ or trade for new slide rule.

I think they are fine where they are.

That's not really possible.

I don't need to use these.

I have no need to take the pictures. Besides, they are fine where they are.

I don't think that will do anything.

That's not a good idea.

I think the case is fine where it is.

I don't have any artifacts on me.

I'm not going to steal them!

It's already closed!

No, they belong in there.

It's a display case with some minor pieces that I collected in my travels.

The case is fine, I don't need to do anything with it.

No, I'd get all wet.

I don't think that'll do anything.

That wouldn't do anything productive.

This can't be opened.

This can't be closed.

Well, I guess I could go for a small drink...

Ah, refreshing.

It's a drinking fountain.

That's not going to happen.

I don't want to get my money all wet.

I don't want to ruin the telegram!

The fountain doesn't need to be tinkered with.

I could move the tape, but I don't want to mess up the paint job or my shoes...

It's taped off because it has just been painted.

That wouldn't help.

I don't think that's a good idea.

I really don't think that will do anything.

It's the janitor's broom.

Where do you think we are? This could work on Mars, but not here!

That's not possible.

That's not really going to work.

I can't really get there, the paint on the stairway is drying.

The hallway is not a person.

That won't do anything useful.

It's the door to my classroom

It's the door to Professor Mulbray's classroom

There's a class in session in there. I don't want to go in and disturb it.

It's the door to Iren's office

This is the janitor's closet

This is the exit to the Campus.

I should find out where Marcus left before I decide to go somewhere.

I better not... I could spill the oil and cause a mess.

No, I don't think that'll work.

It looks to be an oil can, although knowing the janitor it could be anything.

I don't think anybody will mind if I take this.

I can't talk to that!

I don't think I can use anything with that.

Mulbray's chalkboard sure is cluttered.

I don't think the chalkboard will work with that.

I have better things to do than talk to inanimate objects.

I'm not in the mood.

It's attached firmly to the wall.

That wouldn't solve anything.

Why would I want to carry around a chalkboard?

As much fun as it would be to push the desk and give myself a back spasm, I think I'll pass.

I can't give to that.

I don't think Mulbray would like me going through his drawers.

It's a desk.

I'd probably break them if I did that.

I don't think that will do anything useful.

That's not really necessary.

Some photos belonging to Irene, or so I would assume.

I don't think that works.

I don't need Irene's photographs.

I really don't want to do that.

I think they are fine in their present condition.

No, Irene would get mad.

There's no point to that.

I have no need to do that.

It's Irene's desk.

I don't want to bother.

No, I don't think that would do anything.

I don't think Irene would like that.

I don't really want to.

No, that would get Irene mad.

It's today's date: Friday, April 12, 1940. I wish it was the weekend already...

I don't need to take Irene's calendar.

That will never do anything useful.

It's working fine, I don't want to mess with it.

That's not needed.

No, I don't want to mess with it.

There's no need to do that.

This was a gift from the school to Irene.

Seems a bit heavy to carry around...

I have a feeling that will yield no results.

I don't think Irene wants me doing that.

That wouldn't be useful.

It's just Irene's file cabinet.

There's nothing I need from the file cabinet.

I don't want that.

That doesn't really work.

No, I don't think that's a good idea.

I can't really do that.

Pointless... Marcus is not at home.

I hope the mobile phone will be invented soon.

It's my telephone.

II don't want to lug that around.

That won't help my current situation.

I don't need to do that.

It's already a mess, I don't want to make it worse.

No, I don't want to mark these terrible papers now.

My students' work. What a mess.

I have no need for them!

No, that's not going to happen.

The window is already shut.

It looks like a nice day outside.

I don't need to open the window right now.

That wouldn't do anything useful.

That's a bad idea, last time I did that I threw out my back.

That won't do anything.

The drawer is already closed.

No, I don't want to move it.

It's my desk.

There's nothing in the drawer, why bother?

That won't accomplish anything.

I think it's fine where it is.

It's a rare Ancient Roman statue of an Emperor's two pets: We believe that one of them was called Maximus.

It's too heavy for me to do that.

No, that won't solve anything.

Looks pretty heavy, I better not.

I don't think that's possible.

I doubt that will do anything.

Poor Marcus... He bought this from a street vendor in Cairo. He insists that it is actually the nose from the Sphinx...

Now why did I let Marcus talk me into keeping this in here?

I don't think that will work..

These things won't go together.

I think that Chuck is fine where he is.

This used to be at my father's house, but he gave it to me as a gift last year.

Hi Chuck!

I don't think that would work.

Just some oddities I've collected in my travels...

I don't need anything from there.

No, there is nothing from the shelf I need.

I don't want to do that.

It's locked. I need my office key to open it.

It's all gripped.

It's not gripped anymore...

...But it would need a proper shock to be released.

This mode is not in use.

My old file cabinet... So old you could probably call it a relic!

Here's a telegram from Marcus!

I already got the telegram. There's nothing else of interest in the cabinet.

No, I don't want to pick the cabinet up.

It's not going to happen.

Not implemented : Indy take out his hammer

There! The oil has eased the drawer...

But it's still in the wrong position. What it needs now is a good bang.

It doesn't need any more oil. What it needs is a good bang.

Dang. The cabinet is stuck. I knew I should have had someone fix it before.

I guess some lubricant would help.

Now, now. It opens with a key.

A shock would help, but if I don't lubricate it first, I'll just break it.

The lock would be completely stuck.

I'm not using those hammers until I'm sure which one is the fake one.

And now, it's time to give it a good shock.

Wait.

Oh, dear. Which one is the real hammer again?

They look exactly the same!

The copy club seems to have made enormous progress. I'm in big trouble.

a hammer

another hammer

OK, that's the fake hammer for sure.

*BANG!*

Everything alright there, professor?

Yes, Irene, thank you!

I'm not using an authentic ceremonial hammer[as a vulgar tool!

I don't need to add that to the file cabinet.

It's a genuine ceremonial hammer.

It's not hammer time.

I'll take it

It's a copy of a ceremonial hammer.

I think that this will teach old Doctor Jones a lesson not to mess with us!

He won't be going anywhere for awhile with a slashed tire, will he, Bruno?

Haw haw haw!

Just, great... It looks like someone slashed my tire!

I can't pull my car!

I have no need to push my car.

I don't think I can give to my car.

I better close the trunk first...

Arizona, here I come!

I can't leave now, the tire is flat!

It's my car.

No, that won't do anything.

Maybe if I use this with the flat tire...

Now that's what I call some good work.

And I'm not even dirty.

There's no point to that...

The trunk works fine, I don't need to do anything with it.

It's the trunk of my car.

I can't close that!

That's not going to improve anything.

No, that can't work.

I'm not walking to the airport, it's tens of miles away!

... This stone artifact was discovered in my class dig.

Several other Aborigine artifacts were discovered in the dig.

Now the dig wasn't a major dig and the artifacts we discovered were not major finds...

But each piece of history that archeology can uncover is important in the large scale of things...

Every clue to man's past is a vital piece of knowledge.

Hey yo, Mr. White!

Imma make some badass pixel-art.

Let's start cooking, BITCH.

This screen is meant for testing fonts in several languages.

Please note that it only tests TTF fonts (that support UTF-8 characters).

(In other words: it only tests native multilingual fonts)

The bits of text that you will see were entered 'as-is' in AGS' script editor.

AGS' script editor does support UTF-8 encoding. The question is : does this font too?

Current font is: 'not implemented yet'

Well actually I did!
A vrai dire, oui je l'espérais!
Who ARE you?
Mais qui êtes-vous?
How did YOU get in here?
Comment êtes-vous entré?
I sell these fine leather jackets.
Je vends de beaux blousons en cuir comme celui-ci.
You thought you could get away that easily!
Tu croyais pouvoir t'en tirer comme ça!
Wake up, pal. It's 1938! It belongs in a museum!
Ecoutez, l'ami. On est en 1938. Sa place est dans un musée!
Do you think Jesus' toe is actually in this box?
Vous pensez vraiment que cette boîte contient l'orteil de Jésus? 
The catacombs are outside monastery land.
Les catacombes n'appartiennent pas au monastère.
I was hired by the Vatican.
C'est le Vatican qui m'envoie.
I am brother Bernard, of the monastery of Saint-Luc,
Je suis Frère Bernard, du monastère de Saint Luc,
and this OUR crypt!
et ceci est NOTRE crypte!
How DARE you trespass and steal our most precious property?
Comment OSEZ-VOUS essayer de voler notre bien le plus précieux?
Give back the toe at once!
Rendez l'orteil immédiatement!
ENOUGH OF THAT NONSENSE!
ÇA SUFFIT!
I know all the secret passages!
Je connais tous les passages secrets!
Give me the box this instant or I lock you up in here!
Donnez-moi cette boîte immédiatement ou je vous enferme ici!
OK, pal, no need to go all inquisitor on me.
D'accord, l'ami, pas la peine de faire l'inquisiteur.
Here you go.
Tenez.
Umph.
*Grommelle*
Look, we started on the wrong FOOT...
Ecoutez, on a démarré du mauvais PIED...
Aren't you going to open it?
Vous ne voulez vraiment pas l'ouvrir?
What do you REALLY think is inside?
Que pensez-vous qu'elle contient vraiment?
It's fake anyways.
De toute façon c'est clairement un faux.
That's not funny, thief.
Ce n'est pas drôle, Monsieur le voleur.
I despise your casualness and your hypocrisy!
Votre désinvolture et votre hypocrisie me donnent la nausée! 
No one looks at the relic! Even me, its guardian.
Personne ne pose les yeux sur la relique! Même pas moi, son gardien.
In 10 centuries, we have never had the audacity to open this box.
En dix siècles, nous n'avons jamais eu l'audace d'ouvrir cette boîte.
Besides, this relic is so holy that seeing it would probably...
Par ailleurs, cette relique est tellement sainte que si vous la voyiez...
BURN your sinner's eyes!
Cela vous BRÛLERAIT sûrement les yeux!
I know what's OUTSIDE. This world is rotting.
Non, mais je sais ce qu'on trouve DEHORS. Un monde en putréfaction!
I can already hear the seven trumpets...
J'entends déjà les sept trompettes...
...OF THE APOCALYPSE!
...DE L'APOCALYPSE!
You wish! This reliquary has been hidden in the crypt for centuries.
N'y comptez pas! Ce reliquaire est caché dans notre crypte depuis des siècles.
And all that time, we protected it from satanic creatures...
Pendant tout ce temps, nous l'avons protégé des suppôts de satan... 
...LIKE YOURSELF!
...COMME TOI, VOLEUR!
BLASPHEMY!
BLASPHÈME!
I WARNED YOU to respect the name of the Lord in my presence!
Je vous avais AVERTI de respecter le nom du Créateur en ma présence!
Easy there, pal.
Du calme, l'ami.
I've had enough of your sarcastic tone and your cursing!
J'en ai assez de votre ironie et de vos jurons!
For ONCE in your miserable life you will lay eyes on the most precious relic!
Pour UNE FOIS dans votre vie misérable, vous allez voir la relique la plus précieuse!
And then never again!
Ce sera la première et la dernière fois!
BEHOLD!
OUVRE LES YEUX ET VOIS!
...
...
It's empty, you know.
C'est vide, vous savez.
!?!

Let me see.
Laissez-moi voir.
It's-- It's empty!
Mais c'est... C'est vide!
That can't be!
Ce n'est pas possible!
Look, there are some unusual scratchings inside.
Regardez, il y a de drôles de rayures à l'intérieur.
Wait a minute, these are not scratchings!
Attendez, ce ne sont pas de simples rayures!
This is the runic alphabet!
C'est de l'alphabet runique! 
The letters seem to have been carved hastily with a sharp object.
Les lettres semblent avoir été gravées à la hâte avec une lame.
Do you understand this pagan language? What does it say?
Vous comprenez ce language de païens? Qu'est-ce que ça dit?
I'm a bit rusty, the real specialist here would be Marcus.
Attendez que je me souvienne. Le vrai spécialiste, c'est Marcus.
Who?
Qui ça?
Never mind.
Non, rien.
I believe it says...
Je crois que ça dit...
"Agsvald was here"
"Vous avez le bonjour d'Agsvald"
Wh-- Are you sure?
Que... Vous êtes sûr?
Yikes!
Beurk!
Do you hear yourself?
Non mais, vous vous entendez parler?
Golly!
Saperlipopette!
Jiminy Cricket!
Nom d'un chien!
Oh for God's sake!
Nom de dieu!
What did you say!?
Qu'avez-vous dit?
Erm, nothing serious.
Euh, pas grand chose.
Zounds!
Eh bien!
Thats sounds extreme!
Ça me semble exagéré.
Bejabbers!
Saperlotte!
Did you really say that?
Ventrebleu!
For God's sake!
Nom de dieu!
These are strong words.
Vous y allez fort.
Ouch!
Aïe!
Are you for real?
Vous êtes sérieux?
That hurt.
Ne soyez pas blessant.
I'm not lying, we can find an arrangement.
Je dis la vérité, je suis sûr qu'on peut s'arranger.
People usually find me charming.
D'habitude on me trouve plutôt charmant.
Name one more thing you hate about me.
Je me demande d'où vous vient toute cette animosité.
Come on now, you're just being mean.
Allons, allons, pas de méchanceté inutile.
I doubt it. I do not consort with the spawns of Belzebub.
J'en doute. Je ne fraye pas avec les suppôts de Belzebuth.
I know a certain snake that was charming too. Repent!
Le serpent, lui aussi, sut se faire charmeur! Repens-toi!
The thing I hate the most is blasphemy!
Ce que je déteste le plus, c'et le blasphème.
"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain."
"Tu n'utiliseras pas le nom du Seigneur en vain"
Whenever I hear someone use God's name to curse, I could just--
Quand j'entends quelqu'un jurer en utilisant le nom de Dieu, je sors de mes gonds.
It is not I who judge you, it is the Almighty.
Ce n'est pas moi qui vous juge, c'est le tout puissant.
Strange as it sounds, I'm pretty sure.
Aussi étrange que ça paraisse, absolument certain.
Agsvald sounds like a Viking name.
Agsvald... On dirait un nom Viking.
When did you last check on the relic?
Quand avez-vous ouvert la boîte pour la dernière fois?
You should have picked Runic over Latin.
Vous auriez dû étudier le Runique, pas le Latin.
That is a CATASTROPHY!
C'est une CATASTROPHE!
We've been watching over the Holy remains for almost a millenium!
Nous avons gardé les Restes Saints pendant près d'un millénaire!
You're telling me that all that time they had been taken away?
Et vous me dites que pendant tout ce temps ils avaient été volés?
And by some bearded pagan adventurer at that!
Et par une espèce d'aventurier hirsute, en plus!
Wait, there's more.
Attendez, il y a plus!
"Come get the body parts of your whiny god in Nissefest, if you dare."
"Venez chercher les parties de votre dieu pleurnichard à Nissefest, si vous osez."
Our Lord is not whiny! How dare you!
Hé! Notre Seigneur n'est pas pleunichard!
Hey, I'm just reading it as it is. Our friend Agsvald knows how to tease.
Je vous le traduis tel quel. Notre ami Agsvald est du genre provocateur.
What is this Nissefest he's talking about?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce "Nissefest" dont il parle?
I think it used to be a Viking settlement in Norway, many centuries ago.
Je crois que c'était un camp Viking en Norvège, il y a des siècles de ça.
My son, the time has come for you to answer to a higher calling.
Mon fils, l'heure est venue pour toi de répondre à l'appel du destin.
You must be kidding me.
Non mais dites-moi que je rêve.
You must bring back the relic, the salvation of your soul depends on it.
Tu dois ramener la relique, le salut de ton âme en dépend.
Yeah, yeah.
Ouais, ouais.
Plus, I would let you see the rare manuscripts of our monastry.
En plus, je pourrais te donner accès aux manuscrits rares du monastère.
Say no more.
N'en dites pas plus.
monkDialogFinished

I'm done with you.
Nous nous sommes tout dit.
I've had enough.
J'en ai assez.
Me and my relic, we're gone.
Je m'en vais avec ma relique.
What now.
Quoi?
Can't you find the exit yourself?
Vous ne voulez pas qu'en plus je vous montre la sortie?
Don't insist, the reliquary stays closed.
N'insistez pas, le reliquaire reste fermé.
Hello! I'm an American archeologist.
Bonjour! Je suis un archéologue américain.
Could I speak to someone in town?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un en ville à qui je puisse parler?
Maybe I can help you with your boat?
Je peux peut-être vous aider avec votre bateau.
What is it you need again?
Rappelez-moi de qui vous avez besoin.
I'll let you work.
Je vous laisse travailler.
Oj, oj, oj.
Oj, oj, oj.
Sorry sir, I'm too busy, I cannot help you.
Désolé Monsieur, je suis trop occupé pour vous aider.
It's the fishing season. Everyone's at sea from dusk till dawn.
C'est la saison de la pêche. Tout le monde est au large du matin au soir.
Except for me. My boat is damaged and I must fix it urgently.
A part moi. Mon bateau est en panne et je dois le réparer d'urgence.
I really don't have time to talk, good bye sir.
Je n'ai vraiment pas le temps de parler, au revoir Monsieur.
Ha! I don't think so.
Ha! J'en doute!
This old thing's engine has been patched so many times...
Le moteur de ce vieux rafiot a été réparé tant de fois...
...I'm probably the only person to know how to make it work.
...que je suis sûrement la seule personne à savoir comment il marche.
It used to finish the Fjord run in 12 nautic miles, you know.
Autrefois il a fini le Raid de Fessel en douze miles nautiques, vous savez.
Anyways I'm too busy to continue this little chat.
Bref, je suis trop occupé pour continuer à papoter.
But if I help you fix it will you answer my questions?
Mais si je vous aide à le réparer, vous répondrez à mes questions?
Listen min herr, I told you--
Écoutez min herr, je viens de vous dire que...
Hmm...
Hmm...
OK, listen.
Bon, écoutez.
Next to the church, there's an old storehouse where I keep some tools.
À côté de l'église, il y a une vieille bâtisse où je garde des outils.
And inside of it there's a hose. Bring it back to me and we'll see.
À l'intérieur, il y a un tuyau. Amenez-le moi et on verra.
In the meantime I'll be busy with min lille hammer.
Entre-temps, je vais continuer de cogner sur min lille hammer. 
hasReceivedFishermanMission

Oj! I thought I was clear!
Oj! Je croyais avoir été clair!
Bring me the hose that's in the old storehouse, and I'll help you.
Amenez-moi le tuyau qui se trouve dans la vieille cabane, et je vous aiderai.
Hurry up please, while I tighten a few bolts.
Dépêchez-vous voulez-vous, je reserre quelques écrous.
If you don't mind.
Si vous voulez bien.
About the church...
Au sujet de l'église...
About that pile of ashes on the hill...
Au sujet de ce tas de cendres sur la colline...
Seen any vikings around  lately?
Vous n'auriez pas vu des Vikings dans le coin?
Bye bye.
Au revoir.
Yes?
Oui?
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!
Bye bye!
Au revoir!
Does your church host a relic or two?
Il y a bien une relique ou deux dans votre église, non?
Quite authentic!
Elle a l'air de dater!
I've noticed those strange holes in the wall...
J'ai remarqué de drôles de trous dans le mur...
Can you sing one of his songs?
Vous pouvez me chanter une de ses chansons?
Would you sing another song?
Vous voulez bien me chanter une autre chanson?
How about another song?
Allez, encore une chanson?
You have quite the sense of humor!
Vous avez de l'humour, vous!
But it's a tiny church. No relics. Not even a crypt.
Cette église est minuscule. Pas de reliques, pas même une crypte.
Yes, it's extremely old. From the times of massive Christian conversions.
Oui, elle est très vieille. Du temps des nombreuses conversions au christianisme.
I even believe it was built on top of the Viking common hall.
Je crois même qu'elle a été construite par-dessus la bâtisse commune du village Viking.
Peculiar, aren't they?
Ils sont inhabituels, hein?
As a kid, I used to imagine it was the holes of a flute.
Quand j'étais gamin, je m'imaginais que c'étaient les trous d'une flûte.
I get it. A boring mass can make the mind wander.
Je vois. Quand la messe est ennuyeuse, l'esprit vagabonde.
Not only that, but our priest enjoyed music a lot.
Pas seulement: Notre prêtre adorait la musique.
He had lots of songs to help us remember events and dates from the Bible.
Il avait toujours plein de chansons pour nous aider à mémoriser le catéchisme.
Do you mean... Songs he invented himself?
Vous voulez dire... Des chansons qu'il inventait lui-même? 
Well, erm... That's a bit embarrassing.
Eh bien, euh... C'est un peu gênant.
Come on, I helped you with your engine.
Allez, je vous ai aidé avec votre moteur.
Wouldn't you prefer a drinking song?
Vous ne voulez pas plutôt une chanson paillarde?
OK, here goes :
Bon, d'accord. Je me lance:
'Adam has Abel, that's one son...',
'Adam a Abel, ça lui fait un fils...'
'Adam has Cain, that's two sons...'
'Adam a Caïn, ça lui fait deux fils...'
'Cain kills Abel, that's one son again...'
'Caïn tue Abel, retour à un fils...'
'Adam has Seth, that's two sons again...'
'Adam a Seth, retour à deux fils...'
I think I get the gist of it.
Je crois que j'ai compris les grandes lignes.
That's a boring song but thanks to it I never forgot the genealogy of Adam.
La chanson est nulle mais grâce à elle je n'ai jamais oublié la généalogie d'Adam.
I wish my dad knew how to sing.
Si seulement mon père avait su chanter!
How about this one:
Que pensez-vous de celle-ci:
'the hip bone connects to the leg bone,'
'L'os de la hanche est relié à l'os de la jambe,'
'The leg bone connects to the--'
'L'os de la jambe est relié à...'
I already know that one.
Celle-là je la connais déjà.
Yes, I think the priest adapted it from a famous song.
Oui, je crois bien que le prêtre l'a adaptée d'une chanson célèbre.
I don't know any more songs but that one:
Je n'en connais aucune autre, à part celle-là:
'A door has a lock, the lock needs a key',
'Chaque porte a un verrou, chaque verrou a une clé',
'Push it three times!'
'Pousse-le trois fois!'
'The lock can also be a key',
'Le verrou peut aussi être une clé',
'Then the lock opens another door',
'Alors le verrou ouvre une autre porte',
The tune is catchy.
L'air est entraînant.
Yes. The priest was singing to himself very often. I remember it to this day.
Oui. Le prêtre fredonnait cette chanson très souvent sans y réfléchir. Je m'ens ouviens encore.
hasRevealedDoorMechanism

When did it burn?
A quand remonte l'incendie?
I've seen some runes next to it.
J'ai vu des runes juste à côté.
Nevermind
Peu importe.
Very recently, actually.
Il est très récent, à vrai dire.
It belonged to our priest's family since forever.
La bâtisse appartenait à la famille du prêtre depuis toujours.
Do you mean they maintained it?
Vous voulez dire qu'ils l'entretenaient?
Yes, with great care. God knows why.
Oui, avec beaucoup de soin. Allez savoir pourquoi.
So, when the priest died it went derelict.
Donc quand le prêtre est mort elle a commencé à s'effondrer.
Yes, and then this mysterious fire.
Oui, et puis après la bâtisse a mystérieusement pris feu. 
Somehow, the soil is always hot up there, even in winter.
Le sol est toujours chaud là-haut, même en hiver, sans qu'on sache pourquoi.
Could it have started the fire?
C'est ça qui a mis le feu?
Possibly.
Possible.
Oh yes it's extremely old.
Oh oui, très ancien.
There used to be a Viking settlement up there. That furnace was the last remaining trace.
Avant, il y avait un camp Viking là-haut. Ce four était le dernier vestige.
Once, I saw the INSIDE of the furnace door.
Ube fois, j'ai vu l'INTERIEUR de la porte du four.
It's beautiful: Ornamented and all.
Il est très beau: Couvert d'ornements.
Have you heard of a Viking named Agsvald?
Vous avez entendu parler d'un Viking nommé Agsvald?
Do you have... A Vikings museum of some sort?
Vous avez un... musée Viking, ou quelque chose comme ça?
Nevermind.
Peu importe.
Oh yes he was the big shot around here in the early middle ages.
Bien sûr! C'était le caïd de la région, au début du moyen âge.
He kept going on raids to Great Britain, and even to France!
Il a fait beaucoup de raids sur l'Angleterre, et même une fois sur la France. 
To France? Interesting.
Sur la France? Continuez.
The rumour says that he stashed a treasure somewhere here.
La rumeur veut qu'il ait caché un trésor quelque part ici.
But guess what, no one ever found it.
Mais bien sûr, personne ne l'a jamais trouvé.
Oh, no. The mountain is littered with Viking artifacts.
Oh, non. Bien sûr la montagne regorge d'artifacts vikings.
But we're just a small fishing village. I know the stories my grandma's grandma told her.
Mais nous ne sommes qu'un petit village de pêcheurs. On se transmet l'histoire oralement depuis des générations.
So... No reliable source of information?
Donc... Pas de source d'information fiable?
Well, our priest and his family seemed to know many secrets about this Agsvald guy!
Eh bien, notre prêtre et sa famille semblaient en savoir long sur cet Agsvald.
That priest didn't have any children, sadly. His secrets died with him.
Mais le prêtre n'a pas eu d'enfants. Il a emporté ses secrets dans la tombe.

eDialog_LookedAtCompassTag

It's the description tag of one of the many artifacts we have in Barnett college.

I don't know what artifact it describes.

eDialog_IndyConfusedHammers

A short, sturdy stick.
Une tige en bois, courte et solide.
It fits. I got myself a nice shovel.
Ça rentre. J'ai maintenant une belle petite pelle.
It's an empty bucket.
C'est un seau vide.
Luckily, the salted water doesn't seem to be freezing.
Heureusement, l'eau salée ne gèle pas.
It's all rusty but it could do the job if it had a handle.
Couverte de rouille, mais ça pourrait aller si on rajoutait un manche.
It fits!
Ça rentre!
Let me adjust the nail... Voila!
Un petit coup sur le clou... Et voilà!
It's not the right size at all.
Ce n'est pas du tout la bonne taille.
It can't even sharpen the wood to make it fit.
Je ne peux même pas tailler le bois pour l'enfoncer.
eDialog_isOilLampBurning

There, now it's lit.
Voilà, elle est allumée.
The lamp is already lit.
La lampe est déjà allumée.
It was more of a censer apparently, but now it's used as a plain oil lamp.
Apparemment c'était plutôt un encensoir, maintenant utilisé comme lampe à huile.
It has a gentle little flame coming out of it, as expected.
Il y a une douce petite flamme qui en sort, comme souhaité.
There's oil inside but it's not lit.
Il y a de l'huile dedans mais elle est éteinte.
I don't want to put oil all over it.
Je ne veux pas enduire ça d'huile.
There's only oil inside, I don't want to spill it.
Il n'y a que de l'huile dedans, je ne veux pas la renverser.
Talk to me, o genie of the lamp.
Parle-moi, ô génie de la lampe.
[ACHIEVEMENT[[Friend of the Djinns.[[Post a screenshot on Twitter #RelicOfTheViking[[
[OBJECTIF ATTEINT[[Ami des Djinns.[[Postez une capture d'écran sur Twitter #RelicOfTheViking[[
Careful not to hurt your fingers if you try to burn ropes.
Un conseil: Si vous essayez de brûler des cordes, ne vous brûlez pas les doigts.
I don't want to burn that.
Je ne veux pas y mettre feu.
There's a tiny amount of fuel inside, I don't want to spill it.
Il y a un tout petit peu d'essence dedans, je ne veux pas la renverser.
This is a long paddling oar.
C'est une très longue rame en bois.
I have no idea how it fits in my pants.
Je ne sais pas du tout comment elle tient dans mon pantalon.
Unusally big and thick!
Étonnamment longue et épaisse!
Those Norwegians are not fooling around.
On ne plaisante pas, chez les Norvégiens!
It's a small, simple golden key. It looks worn off.
C'est une petie clé dorée très simple. Elle a l'air usée.
It's a shovel.
C'est une pelle.
It's an old plastic hose without much value.
C'est un vieux tuyau en caoutchouc sans grande valeur.
Unbelievable! It's a MASSIVE ruby!
Incroyable! C'est un ÉNORME rubis!
It's an enormous sapphire. I can't believe my eyes.
C'est un énorme saphire. Je n'en crois pas mes yeux.
They'll never believe me, back at the geology department.

That's an impressive pile of bones.
En voilà un tas d'os! Impressionnant.
A tinted glass? Underground?
Un vitrail? Sous terre?
It's open now.
C'est ouvert, maintenant.
That was too close for my comfort.
J'ai bien failli y passer.
I'm not going back there before I find the relic.
Je ne rebrousse pas chemin avant d'avoir trouvé la relique.
Enter the elusive reliquary.
Mesdames et messieurs, sous vos yeux ébahis, l'introuvable reliquaire.
Let's snatch this thing before I get into any more trouble.
J'attrape ce truc et je décampe avant que la situation n'empire.
Reliquaries usually contain bogus body parts.
Habituellement, les reliquaires contiennent de prétendus organes ou os de saints.
I wonder what this one actually contains?
Je me demande ce que celui-ci contient...
Those look pretty steady.
Ils ont l'air solides.
I don't think they're hiding anything.
Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait quoi que ce soit de caché là.
I hope that mine won't end up there.
J'espère que le mien ne finira pas sur cette pile.
I don't see anything special there.
Je ne vois rien de particulier.
I don't think it can be pushed or moved.
Je ne crois pas pouvoir le pousser ou le déplacer.
It's just painted on.

I hope the trip was worth it.
J'espère que le voyage valait le coup.
The door is unlocked.
La porte n'est pas verrouillée.
That makes no sense.
C'est incompréhensible.
A large pile of half-frozen snow has cluttered the old iron door.
Un gros amas de neige gelée bloque la petite porte en fer.
No, there is no time for snowballing.
Je n'ai pas le temps de faire des boules de neige.
Usually I pay some kids to shovel the snow off my sidewalk.
D'habitude je paie des gamins pour enlever la neige de mon trottoir.
Phew!
Pfiou!
I can get snow anywhere, but I don't think I need fresh water.
Je pourrais pendre de la neige n'importe où, mais je ne crois pas avoir besoin d'eau douce.
Can you imagine how much salt water I'd need to melt that much snow?
Il me faudrait une tonne de sel pour faire fondre autant de neige.
That wouldn't work: The snow is slightly frozen and the oar is far from sharp.
Mauvaise idée: La neige est un peu gelée et la rame est très émoussée.
eDialog_DoorState

It seems to have some ornament on the inside. Strange!
On dirait qu'il y a des gravures du côté intérieur. Bizarre!
The angle's not right, I don't see anything. I'd need to open it.
L'angle n'est pas bon, je ne vois rien. Il faudrait que je l'ouvre. 
There. It's still awfully rusty but at least it's not welded shut.
Voilà. C'est toujours affreusement rouillé mais au moins ce n'est plus complètement figé.
eDialog_hasDoorBeenOiled

Hey, this oar is probably over a thousand years old. I won't use it as a lever!
Cette rame a probablement plus de mille ans. Je ne vais pas l'utiliser comme levier!
It would surely break it.
Elle se casserait probablement en deux.
This door is completely gripped! It won't move at all.
La rouille a complètement figé cette porte. Elle ne bouge pas d'un centimètre.
eDialog_DoorCounter

Hmmm, it's getting better. Let's do it again.
Hmm, ça bouge de mieux en mieux. Il faudrait le refaire. 
I think it's time for a final pull instead.
Je ferais mieux de tirer très fort une dernière fois.
It's very rusty, it got stuck half-way. I might loosen it with some efforts.
Elle est tellement rouillée qu'elle est restée bloquée à mi-chemin. Je dois devoir lui donner du jeu en insistant un peu.
Almost there. One of the hinges is crumbling away though.
J'y suis presque. Mais l'une des charnières rouillées tombe en poussière.
It won't open further. I need to continue making it move in either direction.
Elle ne s'ouvrira pas plus. Il faut que je continue à la faire bouger.
OK, one final push should do it!
Allez, une dernière poussée!
*CLUNK!*
*CLONK!*
*CRACK!*
*CRAQUE!*
I'm just glad it didn't fall on my feet.
Je suis content qu'elle ne soit pas tombée sur mon pied.
eDialog_IceCrackOpened

I should try to get rid of that ice.
Je dois me débarrasser de cette glace.
I see someone rummaging inside, but whoever it is they don't notice me.
Je vois quelqu'un travailler à l'intérieur, mais il me tourne le dos, il ne me voit pas.
AHOY! ANYONE ON BOARD?
OHÉ DU BATEAU!
Hva er det?

hasHelpedFisherman

Look, I found the hose you were asking for.
Regardez, j'ai trouvé votre tuyau.
Wonderful! Let me try my little experiment.
Merveilleux! Laissez-moi faire mon petit essai.
*CLANG!*
*KLANG!*
*BONK!*
*ZBONK!*
It works!
Ça marche!
Thank you mister!
Merci bien Monsieur!
Now, tell me. How can I help you?
Alors, dites-moi. Comment puis-je vous aider?
Tusen takk again for helping me! I'm confident I can sail away tomorrow at dawn.
Tusen takk pour votre aide! Maintenant je suis certain de pouvoir partir pêcher demain dès l'aube.
Shaking the boat will only make them hostile. Why not just call?
Si je secoue le bateau, il va m'en vouloir. Pourquoi ne pas simplement appeler?
The boat is surely open already, but there's someone inside.
Le bateau n'est pas fermé, mais il y a quelqu'un dedans.
Why not just call?
Pourquoi ne pas simplement appeler?
There are a few houses and buildings but I wonder where is everyone.
Il y a quelques bâtisses mqis je me demande où sont les habitants.
The sea seems pretty still.
La mer est plutôt calme.
The bucket is already full.
Le seau est déjà plein.
It's one of those medieval Scandinavian churches, entirely made of wood.
C'est une de ces églises scandinaves du moyen âge. Toute en bois!
It's exceptionally well preserved.
Elle est extraordinairement bien préservée.
Even though it's technically christian, I'm certain Vikings were still around when it was built.
Officiellement elle est chrétienne, mais je suis sûr qu'elle date de la fin de la période Viking.
Found it!
Je l'ai trouvé!
There's a TON of junk in there, but it's too dark.
Il y a une TONNE de bazar là-dedans, mais il fait trop sombre.
A lighter is not bright enough to search through it.
Un briquet ne fait pas assez de lumière pour chercher sérieusement.
There's a lot of useless junk in there.
Il y a plein de bric-à-brac inutile.
That wasn't easy.
Ce n'était pas simple.
I also found a shovel head. Not brand new but still good.
J'ai aussi déniché une pelle, mais sans manche. Elle est vieille mais en bon état.
I don't think I'll find anything useful anymore in there.
Je ne crois pas qu'il reste quoi que ce soit d'utile là-dedans.
Those old storehouses can be found everywhere.
On trouve ces vieux greniers enfouis partout par ici.
Scandinavians would preserve salted meet and other goods in them.
Les scandinaves y gardaient la viande salée et toutes sortes de choses.
I'd say it was a furnace or an oven. It's OLD.
Je dirais que c'est un vieux fourneau. Il est TRÈS VIEUX.
But it looks like it burnt very recently.
Mais on dirait qu'il a brûlé tout récemment.
There are just some remains of this so called building.
Il ne reste qu'une ruine.
I don't want to destroy this completely!
Je ne veux pas tout casser!
No doubt, there used to be some Vikings nearby.
Aucun doute, il y a eu des Vikings dans les parages à une époque.
Why should I wandering around with that stone at my back?
Je ne vais pas me promener avec cette énorme pierre sur le dos.
If I didn't know better, I'd say this stone looks like... An ancient pipe?
Si ce n'était pas complètement improbable, je dirais que cette pierre a l'air d'un... antique tuyau?
I pops straight out of the ice wall... And back again into the ground, to God knows where.
Elle sort tout droit de la glace, et disparaît immédiatement dans le sol. Dieu sait où.
It's a huge stone literally popping out of the mountain.
C'est une grosse pierre qui sort tout droit de la montagne.
There's something going on behind that wall.
Il se passe quelque chose derrière cette paroi.
My fiddling with the pipes did something!
Apparemment mes petits tests avec les valves ont produit un résultat!
This steam is going somewhere.
Cette vapeur est acheminée quelque part.
Let's have a closer look...
Voyons voir de plus près...
It's made of massive font... Let's leave it here.
C'est du fer massif. Je vais la laisser là.

WHO DARES WAKING ME FROM MY ETERNAL SLUMBER?
QUI OSE ME TIRER DE MON SOMMEIL ÉTERNEL?
Uh oh!
Oh, oh!
I'm afraid that was me, Agsvald!
C'est moi qui ai fait le coup, Agsvald!
DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
TU CONNAIS MON NOM?
Well yes, you wrote it for me.
Oui, c'est vous qui l'avez laissé écrit.
Do you remember now?
Ça y est ça vous revient?
IF I HAD TO REMEMBER ALL THE PLACES WHERE I WROTE MY NAME!

That's not a very dignified answer...
Voilà une réponse qui manque un peu de dignité...
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND LOKI MORE INSPIRATIONAL THAN ODIN.
MON MAÎTRE À PENSER EST DAVANTAGE LOKI QU'ODIN
No kidding.
Sans blague.
DID YOU COME LOOKING AFTER YOUR SHIELDLESS GOD?
VIENS-TU CHERCHER TON DIEU QUI N'A MÊME PAS D'ÉPÉE?
Well now it doesn't seem that important anymore.
D'un seul coup ça me paraît nettement moins important.
HA! HA! HA!

Easy there, Nur-Ab-Sal.
Hé, du calme Nur-Ab-Sal.
NUR AB WHO?

TONIGHT IS A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT!
CE SOIR EST UNE NUIT TRÈS SPÉCIALE!
IT WILL BE THE LONGEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR.
C'EST LA NUIT LA PLUS LONGUE DE L'ANNÉE.
So?
Et alors?
THIS MUST BE CELEBRATED, AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN.
ELLE DOIT ÊTRE CÉLÉBRÉE SELON LA COUTUME.
With flowers and dances?
Avec des fleurs et des danses?
NO, WITH BEER AND DRUNKEN SINGING.
NON, AVEC DE LA BIÈRE ET DES CHANSONS PAILLARDES.
I MUST GO NOW, THEY ARE ALL WAITING FOR ME.
JE DOIS PARTIR À PRÉSENT, LÀ-HAUT ILS M'ATTENDENT TOUS.
HO HO HO!
HO! HO! HO!
I should go downstairs to do that.
Il faut d'abord que je descende l'escalier.
It's an ancient baptism font. I guess it had a different purpose in Viking times.
C'est un vieux font baptsimal. J'imagine que cette cuvette servait à autre chose au temps Viking.
It's right in front of that curved line on the floor.
Il est situé juste à la pointe de cette ligne peinte au sol.
The bucket is empty. I'm no magician.
Le seau est vide, je ne suis pas magicien.
It's a handwritten note pinned to the wall.
Il y a une petite note manuscrite épinglée au mur. 
It says : 'The key is behind the cross'.
Elle dit: 'La clé est derrière la croix'.
I don't see any cross.
Je ne vois aucune croix.
This one represents the resurrection of Jesus.
Ce tableau représente la résurrection de Jésus.
It's worthless.
Ça ne vaut pas un clou.
This one represents Jesus being crucified.
Ça représente Jésus en train de se faire crucifier.
Hey! There's a small key taped behind the painting!
Hé! Il y a une petite clé scotchée derrière le tableau!
I've already taken the key.
J'ai déjà pris la clé.
This one represents a Roman soldier putting a crown of thorns on Jesus' head.
Celui-ci montre un soldat romain posant la couronne d'épines sur la tête de Jésus.
This one represents Jesus healing the lepers.
Celui-ci montre Jésus qui soigne les lépreux.
This one represents Joseph of Arimathea collecting the blood of Jesus in the Grail.

My parents made me sit countless hours on those church benches.
Mes parents m'ont forcé à assister à tellement de messes sur ce genre de bancs.
I remember how rugged the wood felt.
Je me souviens de leur texture rugueuse sous mes doigts.
Yuck! There's a gum glued to it!
Beurk! Il y a un chewing gum collé!
It's one of those awful old 'gums' made of chewed bark.
C'est un de ces chewing gums bizarres faits de sève de bouleau comme ils mâchent ici.
Oh well, now that I've touched it.
Après tout, maintenant que je l'ai touché...
I'm not starting a collection of old chewing gum, thanks.
Je ne fais pas la collection de vieux chewing gums, merci bien.
Gross.
Dégoûtant.
A rowing paddle. Not too surprising when everyone here is a fisherman.
Une vieille rame, très longue. Sa présence ne m'étonne pas dans un village de pêcheurs.
It seems in good shape.
Elle a l'air en bon état malgré son grand âge.
Why not.
Pourquoi pas?
I used an old technique for efficient packing.
J'ai utilisé une vieille technique d'emballage efficace les objets. 
It was invented by pirates in the Caribbeans.
Elle a été inventée par un jeune pirate dans les Caraïbes.
A medieval shield used as a decoration.
Un bouclier médiéval utilisé comme décoration.
That's weird. The shield seems to be attached to an axis.
Bizarre. Le bouclier est fixé et pivote sur un axe.
This stelle has drawings of fog horns on it.
Cette stèle comporte des dessins de cornes de brume. 
There's a hole carved into each drawing. They seem to be running deep.
Il y a un trou creusé dans chaque dessin de corne. Ils ont l'air profonds.
Wow!
Nom de...
POOOOOOOO

Agsvald's fog horns! Alright!
Les cornes de brume d'Agsvald! Parfait!
pshhhhh...
pshiiiit...
Umph. It doesn't sound like a proper melody?
Euh. Pas très mélodieux.
Some sea water mist!
Du brouillard d'eau de mer!
*Crrrrrrr*

It's like they're moving along a wave! Perfect!
Ils ondulent en rythme comme le drakkar sur les vagues! Excellent!
They're just clunking but nothing good seems to be happening.
Ils s'entrechoquent sans but, ça ne me paraît pas être l'effet recherché.
The dragon is coming to life!
Le dragon prend vie!
Something is not quite triggering there.
A mon avis quelque chose devrait se produire.
The stone is very hot, but... Not mist at all.
La pierre est très chaude, mais... Pas de brume.
Pretty disappointing.
Assez décevant.
I have a hunch that's not just an art installment.
J'ai l'intuition que ce n'est pas uniquement une installation artistique.
Well, at least SOME of it seemed correct.
Au moins, CERTAINES choses semblaient marcher correctement.
I need to make this thing work!
Il faut que je fasse marcher ce machin!
This dragon has an unusually long tongue.
Ce dragon a une langue étonnamment longue.
I can't pick it up entirely but it seems to be able to slide.
Je ne peux pas la retirer entièrement mais je crois qu'elle peut coulisser.
Nothing happened.
Rien ne s'est passé.
I don't see the mop.
Je ne vois pas la serpillère.
There's a small oil lamp resting on the basin.
Il y a une petite lampe à huile posée sur le bassin.
I was sent by church representatives, after all.
Après tout, je suis en mission pour un ecclésiastique.
There's only the stick, the rest is missing.
Il n'y a que le manche, le reste manque.
This is a massive dragon head carved in wood.
C'est une énorme tête de dragon sculptée dans le bois.
It still has tiny seashells here and there.
Il y a encore quelques coquillages accrochés dessus.
I think it could have been at the front of a Viking longboat.
Je me demande si c'était la figure de proue d'un drakkar.
It won't budge.
Ça ne bouge pas.
I'm too far away.
Je suis trop loin.
It seems like my fiddling with the pipes did something after all.
Hé bien, mes petits tests avec les valves ont fini par faire effet.
Just the striking plate to the door's lock.
C'est la plaque en métal de la serrure.
A secret compartment just opened at the back of the cabinet!
Un compartiment secret vient de s'ouvrir au fond du placard!
WOW! It contains two huge gems!
Nom de... Il contient deux gemmes ÉNORMES!
I believe this church holds many secrets.
Cette église semble receler de nombreux secrets.
I think there's nothing more here.

Those are very condensed runes, but it's along the lines of:
Ces runes sont très ramassées, mais elles veulent dire en substance:
'Agsvald's ship sails away in the morning mist,'
'Le drakkar d'Agsvald naviguera dans les brumes du matin,'
'All shields readied',
'Tous les boucliers parés',

VER:1.1DATA:I can't do much with only the head.
VER:1.1DATA:Je ne peux pas faire grand chose juste avec la tête.
VER:1.1DATA:It's open. All I have to do is crawl into it.
VER:1.1DATA:C'est ouvert. Je n'ai qu'à ramper dedans.
VER:1.1DATA:What now? It took me a lot of efforts to reveal that passageway.
VER:1.1DATA:Et maintenant? J'en ai sué pour ouvrir ce passage.
VER:1.1DATA:I see someone rummaging inside. The guy is turning his back, he doesn't see me.
VER:1.1DATA:Je vois quelqu'un s'agiter à l'intérieur. Il me tourne le dos et ne me voit pas.
VER:1.1DATA:There are a few houses and buildings, nothing of much interest.
VER:1.1DATA:Il y a quelques maisons et bâtiments, sans grand intérêt.
VER:1.1DATA:But I wonder where is everyone.
VER:1.1DATA:Mais je me demande pourquoi il n'y a personne.
VER:1.1DATA:Why should I be wandering around with that stone on my back?
VER:1.1DATA:Je ne vais quand même pas me promener avec cette pierre sur le dos...
VER:1.1DATA:I've pushed the lock three times, but nothing happened.
VER:1.1DATA:J'ai poussé le verrou trois fois, mais il ne s'est rien passé.
VER:1.1DATA:Maybe I should push the lock that's inside?
VER:1.1DATA:Peut-être qu'il faut le pousser une fois la porte ouverte?
VER:1.1DATA:Nah. I think they're just holes. I don't see any mechanism.
VER:1.1DATA:Non, je pense que ce sont de simples trous. Je ne vois aucun mécanisme.
VER:1.1DATA:Those holes are pretty large. It's hopeless trying to patch them up.
VER:1.1DATA:Ces trous sont assez gros. C'est en vain que j'essaierais de les boucher.
VER:1.1DATA:Surely a good melody doesn't have ALL the notes at the same time.
VER:1.1DATA:A mon avis, une bonne mélodie ne joue pas TOUTES les notes en même temps.
VER:1.1DATA:Is it supposed to make this sizzling noise?
VER:1.1DATA:Est-ce que c'est vraiment censé grésiller comme ça?
VER:1.1DATA:That's where the sizzling noise came from.
VER:1.1DATA:Le grésillement venait de là.
VER:1.1DATA:That'd be more useful if I took the lamp first.
VER:1.1DATA:Ce serait plus malin de prendre la lampe d'abord.
VER:1.1DATA:There's a cavity in place of each eye.
VER:1.1DATA:A la place de chaque oeil, et sur le front, il y a une cavité.
VER:1.1DATA:There are some carvings in the wood here.
VER:1.1DATA:Il y a des gravures dans le bois à cet endroit.
VER:1.1DATA:Unfortunately it's too dark up here to see what it represents.
VER:1.1DATA:Malheureusement il fait trop sombre, je ne vois pas ce que ça représente.
VER:1.1DATA:Three dots drawn on five horizontal lines.
